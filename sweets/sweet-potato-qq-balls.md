# Sweet Potato QQ Balls

* 180 g Sweet Potato 
* 60 g Tapioca 
* 30 g Sugar 
* Pinch of Salt 
* 1-2 Tbsp Water 

Note: Recommended ratio for sweet potato, tapioca and sugar is 6:2:1

1. Peel and cut sweet potato into cubes using a peeler and sharp knife. Steam for 12 minutes until fully cooked.
2. Mash potato into paste, mix with sugar and salt immediately, add in tapioca flour and mix until soft dough is formed while still hot.
3. Add in water gradually, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough reach the consistency of a playdough.
4. Divide dough into small portions, roll into marble-sized balls with your palms.
5. Drop the potato balls into oil when the oil starts to heat up, about 120Â°C to 130C****. Let it sits in the oil for about 1-2 minutes before stirring them. Use medium-low heat to avoid burning.
6. Continue stirring and gently press down while frying. Sweet potato balls will expand in size. The secret is to gently press until the balls expand, crispy crust will form around the chewy and hollow center.
